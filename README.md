## Design Process
The website is for three different groups of users; Adminstrator, Staff and Students from IMGD. The website is mainly used for IMGD course-relaated information regarding the softwares and projects involved with Students and Lecturers. To achieve the target and for it to be the most ideal way for different users to make use of these system. Different users will have different extent of abilities and permission to view information that will be useful for them in regards to the roles they are assigned to.

 As a Adminstrator, I will want to have full access to all the information of the staffs and students as will as the ability to modify and change information.
 As a Staff, I will want to have access to all the information of students and information for the staffs.
 As a Student, I will want to have access to information for students only.

Adminstrators: Can view all the pages and equipped with permission to modify details.
Staff: View all the informative pages but have no permission to modify information.
Students: View pages with information of students only.

        This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
        These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
        Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
